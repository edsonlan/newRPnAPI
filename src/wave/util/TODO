1. Fix up expect() and add next_label(), first_label(), and last_label()
to label.{h,cc}.  Use these functions in extract_first() and extract_last()
in Extractable.cc.

2. Get rid of GPL code:  errorhandler has to be removed from multid (perhaps
replaced by exceptions).

NOTE:  getopt is part of POSIX, so the files getopt.{c,h} were moved to SAVE.
If getopt is not generally available, it will have to be reinstated.
